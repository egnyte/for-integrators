# File picker example standalone

This is the most basic example of how to use Egnyte SDK file picker along with in-browser auth.

`app.js` contains the code for the whole example

- If your integration has a back-end, please consider using Auth Code flow with token being issued to your back-end instead.

## How to run

```
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` will start a server on [https://localhost:8081/](https://localhost:8081/)

Prepare your Egnyte domain and an API Key you can use with it and open [https://localhost:8081/](https://localhost:8081/) - the demo will prompt for those.
